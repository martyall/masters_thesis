# Masters Thesis:
## Title : The Riemann Hypothesis for Hypersurfaces over finite fields.

The thesis treats and simplifies a new argument for the Riemann hypothesis portion of the Weil Conjectures
in the special case of hypersurfaces. Interestingly enough, a deformation argument proves this is equivalent
to the full statement of smooth, proper varieties.
